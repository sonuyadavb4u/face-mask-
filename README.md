COVID-19 pandemic caused by coronavirus is 
constantly spreading all over the world. The affect of COVID 
has fallen on almost all development sectors. The healthcare 
system goes through crisis. Measures have been taken to 
prevent the spreading of this virus where wearing a mask is 
one of them. In this paper, we proposed a system that will 
detect people who are not wearing mask where all the public 
places are monitored by CCTV cameras. The face mask 
detection system is developed with a machine learning 
algorithm: MobileNetV1. The steps for building the model are 
collecting the photos of people wearing masks and not wearing 
masks or taking normal images of people and make custom CV 
script to add masks on them , then pre-processing the data and 
splitting the data, testing and then implementing the model.
The model can detect people who are wearing mask or not 
wearing mask at an accuracy ranging 98.71-99.90 percent.                           


**`Introduction`**
As the COVID cases are rising day by day and even after 
lockdown still many people roam around streets without 
wearing mask, means lockdown is not the only solution to 
prevent covid expansion, so we need a proper system to 
monitor who is wearing mask or not wearing mask because 
people canâ€™t stay at home because they have to do their job, 
earn money to take care of their family and because of that 
sometimes many people forgot to wear mask. As of now,
there are some vaccines available in many countries but still 
it does not mean that we are 100% safe from covid.
The people are forced by law to wear a mask wherever they 
communicate with other people and in the public places
.The government punish those people who disobey and do 
not use a face mask in the public place.
Authorities faced many difficulties in monitoring a large 
population. Therefore, the authorities need a solution to this 
problem and to control the implementation of the law and 
solution is to use face mask detection system to detect people who disobeys and do not wear a mask.
This paper introduces face mask detection system that can 
be used by the people in home or in public places etc. Now 
what it can do is it can capture the image of a person at that 
instant who is not wearing mask and send it to the authority, it 
can inform the authorities via any mail service. It can be used 
in homes, so that if any person is not wearing mask then the 
doors will not open.
The deployed model in this study can be implemented on 
cameras to detect the people who are not wearing mask.
